## Hello, my dear friend,

I hope this email finds you in great health. It has been a while since our last exchange, and I completely understand you’ve been busy. However, I’d love to hear back from you—feel free to send me your feedback whenever you can.

Today, while browsing the internet, I came across some fascinating insights. Did you know that in 2020, **the gig economy grew by 33%**, expanding **8.25 times faster than the overall US economy**? That same year, **2 million Americans tried gig work for the first time**, and the gig economy now employs **34% of all US workers**.

## The Need for Extra Income

Every day, people search “how to make money online” on Google, a query with **over 100 million monthly searches**. Digging deeper into this trend reveals three types of people:

1. Those who want to earn without doing much.
2. Those willing to work but not interested in learning new skills.
3. Those eager to work and learn new skills.

For this email, I want to share some tools and ideas that cater to each group—practical ways to start earning online today!

### The Lazy Method: Survey Sites

For those who want to make money with minimal effort, survey sites might be the easiest option. Platforms like **InboxDollars** and **Swagbucks** allow you to earn by completing small tasks like watching videos or reviewing audio. However, keep in mind that these methods are slow and won’t replace a full-time income.

### For the Skill Seekers

If you’re open to learning a new skill, platforms like **YouTube** are your best friends. Search for tutorials on topics such as **copywriting**, **graphic design**, or **digital marketing**. Once you feel confident in your newfound skill:

1. **Set up a profile on Fiverr**: ☞ [https://bit.ly/FiVErr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr)
2. Create a **TikTok business account**: Share your learning process using trending sounds and link your Fiverr gigs or personal website.

By sharing your journey and expertise, you can attract clients and build credibility in your field.
